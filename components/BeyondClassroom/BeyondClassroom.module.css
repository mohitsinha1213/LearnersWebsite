/* Specific grid layout based on design */
/* Row 1: Grounds (Left), Library (Right) - Wait, design shows Grounds is large on left? 
   Actually, looking at the image:
   Row 1: World-Class Grounds (Left, maybe 50%), Library (Right, 50% but split?)
   Actually, it looks like a masonry or complex grid.
   Let's approximate:
   Row 1: Grounds (Left half), Library (Right top half).
   Row 2: Smart Classrooms (Left bottom?), Clubs (Right middle?), Stem Labs (Right bottom?).
   
   Let's look closer at "Beyond the classroom" section in the image.
   It has 2 rows.
   Row 1: 
     - Left: "World-Class Grounds" (Image of kids playing).
     - Right: "Library" (Image of shelves).
   Row 2:
     - Left: "Smart Classrooms" (Image of class).
     - Middle: "Clubs and Societies" (Blue card with text and small image).
     - Right: "Stem Labs" (Image of lab).
   
   Wait, the layout in the image is:
   Top Row: "World-Class Grounds" (Left, Large), "Library" (Right, Wide).
   Bottom Row: "Smart Classrooms" (Left), "Clubs and Societies" (Middle, Blue), "Stem Labs" (Right).
   
   Actually, "World-Class Grounds" seems to take full height of left column? No.
   Let's assume a 3-column grid or 2-column.
   
   Let's try a CSS Grid with areas.

    /* Full height left? Or just top left? */
    /* Image shows Grounds is on the left, maybe taking 1/3 width and full height? 
     Or maybe top left. 
     Let's look at the text "World-Class Grounds". It's at the bottom of the card.
     The card is tall.

     Row 2: Smart Class (1/3), Clubs (1/3), Stem Labs (1/3)
     
     But Grounds looks taller in some designs. 
     In the provided image:
     "World-Class Grounds" is on the left.
     "Library" is on the top right.
     "Clubs" is below Library?
     "Smart Classrooms" is below Grounds?
     "Stem Labs" is below Clubs?
     
     Actually, looking at the image "Beyond the classroom":
     Top Left: World-Class Grounds.
     Top Right: Library.
     Bottom Left: Smart Classrooms.
     Bottom Middle: Clubs.
     Bottom Right: Stem Labs.
     
     It looks like a 2x3 grid?
     Row 1: Grounds (Left), Library (Right, spans 2 cols?)
     Row 2: Smart Class, Clubs, Stem Labs.
     
     Let's try:
     Grid columns: 1fr 1fr 1fr
     Row 1: Grounds (1fr), Library (2fr)
     Row 2: Smart Class (1fr), Clubs (1fr), Stem Labs (1fr)

   This matches the visual weight.
